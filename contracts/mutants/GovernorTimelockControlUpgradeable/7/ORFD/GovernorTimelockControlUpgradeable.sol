/**
 * @dev Extension of {Governor} that binds the execution process to an instance of {TimelockController}. This adds a
 * delay, enforced by the {TimelockController} to all successful proposal (in addition to the voting duration). The
 * {Governor} needs the proposer (and ideally the executor) roles for the {Governor} to work properly.
 *
 * Using this model means the proposal will be operated by the {TimelockController} and not by the {Governor}. Thus,
 * the assets and permissions must be attached to the {TimelockController}. Any asset sent to the {Governor} will be
 * inaccessible.
 *
 * WARNING: Setting up the TimelockController to have additional proposers besides the governor is very risky, as it
 * grants them powers that they must be trusted or known not to use: 1) {onlyGovernance} functions like {relay} are
 * available to them through the timelock, and 2) approved governance proposals can be blocked by them, effectively
 * executing a Denial of Service attack. This risk will be mitigated in a future release.
 *
 * _Available since v4.3._
