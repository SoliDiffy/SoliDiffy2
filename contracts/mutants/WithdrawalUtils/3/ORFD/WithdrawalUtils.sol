/// @title Contract that can be used by sponsors to request withdrawals from
/// sponsor wallets and Airnodes/relayers to fulfill these
/// @notice The respective Airnode/relayer may not support withdrawals for the

/// funds directly to the sponsor address without being prompted, e.g., because
/// they are ceasing operations. In general, no guarantee is provided for the
/// funds deposited to sponsor wallets at the protocol level. Therefore, the
/// sponsors should limit their deposits to the minimum amount required for
/// their operations, and assume they will not receive these funds back.
/// @dev Withdrawals are implemented in the form of pull payments. The sponsor
/// requests a withdrawal from a sponsor wallet, and the Airnode/relayer uses
/// the specified sponsor wallet to deposit the entire balance at this
/// contract. Then, the sponsor claims/pulls the payment from this contract.
/// Different protocols (RRP, PSP, etc.) use different sponsor wallets for a
/// particular Airnode/relayerâ€“sponsor pair, which is why sponsor wallet
/// derivation includes a protocol ID. Refer to the node documentation for what
/// these protocol IDs are.
